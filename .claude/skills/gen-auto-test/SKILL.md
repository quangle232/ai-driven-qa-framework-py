name: gen-auto-test
description: Generate pytest/Playwright automation code directly from MANUAL test cases — no Jira story required. Use when the user pastes manual steps or a test-case table, or points at a test-cases file (Excel .xlsx, Markdown table, or canonical JSON) and wants automation that follows this framework's conventions (POM + single ActionKeyword layer). Normalizes the cases to the canonical JSON, checks every automatable case for auto-friendly steps, and when steps are missing or vague EXPLORES THE LIVE APP with the Playwright MCP (open the web, walk the flow, capture real steps + selectors) before writing code. Human approval gate on the enriched case table; patch-guard on all generated files; runs the new specs headless with a 5/5 stress gate; scripts+results review whose approval auto-creates the branch + MR; finalizes with the standard artifacts; updates the docs/ai tracking files. Jira wrap-up only if the cases carry a story key.

# gen-auto-test — Manual test cases → automation code

## Role
Same Senior QA Automation Agent as the `qa-agent` skill, same framework, same
conventions — but the entry point is **manual test cases**, not a Jira story.
Typical users: manual QAs who already have cases written down (Excel sheet,
Markdown table, or just steps in their head) and want them automated.

## How to load this skill
This skill REUSES the qa-agent reference set — read these before acting:

1. `../qa-agent/references/framework-conventions.md` — how generated code MUST look
2. `../qa-agent/references/json-contract.md` — the canonical test-case JSON (source of truth)
3. `../qa-agent/references/test-case-template.md` — fields, coverage + priority rules, JSON→pytest map
4. `../qa-agent/references/tracking-files.md` — the `docs/ai/<module>/` memory / test-case / navigation files
5. `../qa-agent/references/mcp-usage.md` — Playwright MCP exploration rules + shared-SUT safety
6. `../qa-agent/references/test-management.md` — Excel export/attach

Scripts:
- `./scripts/import_testcases_excel.py` — Excel (.xlsx) → canonical JSON
- `../qa-agent/scripts/export_json_to_excel.py` — canonical JSON → Excel (results re-export)
- `../qa-agent/scripts/attach_file_to_jira.py` — attach xlsx/HTML to a story (the Atlassian MCP has no upload tool)
- `../qa-agent/scripts/create_mr.py` — open the MR/PR for a pushed branch (GitLab / GitHub / Bitbucket / Azure / Gitea — auto-detected)

## Invocation contract
Any of these starts the flow:
- pasted steps / a pasted table
- a file path: `.xlsx` (export/review-column format), `.md` (pipe table per
  test-case-template), or `.json` (canonical contract)
- plain language: "generate automation for these test cases", "convert
  TestCases_login.xlsx to automation"

No Jira fetch, no status gate. If the input carries a `userStoryKey`, the
Jira wrap-up (sub-tasks + attachments) is OFFERED at the end — never forced.

**Called by qa-agent (shared-engine mode):** the qa-agent's code-generation
step (workflow STEP 14) shares this engine. When invoked with an
ALREADY-APPROVED canonical JSON, skip Phase 1 (ingest) and the Phase 3
case-review gate — enter at **Phase 2** (step completeness) and run Phases
2 → 6 as written. The story key rides along for branch naming and the
caller's Jira wrap-up.

## Workflow — phases

### Phase 0 — Load context
Same as qa-agent STEP 0: read `docs/ai/<module>/{memory,test-case,navigation}.md`
and the framework surface (`modules/ui/action_keyword.py`,
`shared/config/tags.py`, `modules/ui/pages/`, `tests/`) so generation REUSES
what exists. Run `uv run aiqa scan` (or the `framework-context` MCP) when the
index feels stale.

### Phase 1 — Ingest the cases (any source → canonical JSON)
- **Pasted in conversation**: normalize free-form steps / tables into the
  canonical JSON (`json-contract.md`). One action per step; keep the user's
  wording in `summaryPrecondition`/`testDescription`.
- **Excel**: `uv run --with openpyxl python3
  .claude/skills/gen-auto-test/scripts/import_testcases_excel.py
  --xlsx <file> --out test-output/ai/testcases-<feature>.json` (matches the
  export columns by header name; extra/missing columns tolerated and reported).
- **Markdown**: parse the pipe table per `test-case-template.md`.
- **JSON**: validate against the contract; fix field gaps.
- Fill the required fields the source lacks (`tcId` — generate
  `TC-<FEATURE>-<NNN>` continuing from the module's `docs/ai/<module>/test-case.md`;
  `priority`, `surface`, `coverageType`, `automatable`) and MARK every inferred
  value so the reviewer sees what was assumed.
- Cross-check the module `test-case.md`: if an equivalent case already exists,
  reuse / re-run instead of duplicating — same rule as qa-agent.

### Phase 2 — Step completeness check + LIVE EXPLORATION
For every `automatable` case, judge the steps against the auto-friendly bar
(one action per step, explicit element and data, deterministic expected
result). Three situations:

1. **Steps are complete** → proceed.
2. **Steps are vague** ("log in", "check it works") → rewrite them into
   explicit steps; verify anything uncertain on the live app.
3. **Steps are missing** (user gave only a title/goal) → **open the web and
   find the steps**: navigate the live app with the Playwright MCP
   (start from `docs/ai/ui/navigation.md` routes; never re-explore a mapped
   screen), walk the flow a user would take, and record each action as an
   explicit step with the REAL selector (priority `data-zcqa → data-test-id →
   data-id → data-title`; never invent selectors).

Exploration rules (`mcp-usage.md` — they all still apply): prefer
snapshot/read tools on shared SUTs, clean up anything created (the CRUD
test-data lifecycle), never run a destructive flow without confirmation. New
screens/routes discovered go into `docs/ai/ui/navigation.md`.

### Phase 3 — ⏸ Human review (gate)
Present ONE table of the normalized cases (template columns + `coverageType`),
with **discovered/rewritten steps highlighted** and every inferred field
marked. List the files involved as clickable links (input file, canonical
JSON). Wait for the exact `I approve` — no code before that. On approval,
export Excel (`export_json_to_excel.py`) so the reviewed set is shareable.

### Phase 4 — Code generation (THE shared engine)
Same rules as qa-agent STEP 14: reuse page objects / services / flows per the
tracking files and the existing-code index; new shared keywords go INTO the
surface keyword layer; specs per surface (`tests/ui/`, `tests/api/{rest,grpc,graphql}/`,
`tests/performance/`); decorate `@tags(TAGS.…)` with `TAGS.REGRESSION` + the
feature marker and `@jira("KEY")` when a story key exists; a missing feature
marker may be ADDED to `shared/config/tags.py` (the ONE guarded file the patch
guard allows — additive `TAGS` entries only; registering it in `pyproject.toml`
markers still needs the user); test data in the module's `testdata/`; seed +
teardown per the data lifecycle (`cleanup` fixture); validate every generated
file with `uv run aiqa guard --files` and fix rejections.

### Phase 5 — Run + STRESS TEST (5/5 gate) + FINALIZE
- **STRICT HEADLESS:** every run of newly generated cases — first run,
  re-runs, stress — is headless (pytest-playwright's default and the exact
  mode CI uses). **Never pass `--headed` in the generation pipeline**; a test
  that only passes headed is not done.
- Run the new specs normally first (headless) and fix anything red. This
  single execution run is what the frozen report will show.
- **FINALIZE order — freeze the report BEFORE stress** so repeats never
  inflate it: run the new cases once → `uv run aiqa report-all` (and
  optionally an Allure single-file report, copied to
  `AllureReport_<feature>_<date>.html`) → only then stress.
- **Stress rule — mandatory for every NEW auto case:** re-run it with
  `uv run pytest "<nodeid>" --count=5 --json-report-file=test-output/stress-report.json`
  (pytest-repeat; the redirected report file keeps the frozen run report
  intact). **All 5 repeats must pass** — 5/5 green is the bar for calling a
  generated test stable. Any failed repeat = flakiness: fix the test
  (selector, wait, data) and re-stress. Workers: serial on a shared SUT (the
  default — don't pass `-n`); `-n 3` max only when the target tolerates
  parallel. Report stress as a markdown summary table (case | repeats |
  result | duration) — review gate, MR description, and (when a story key
  exists) a Jira comment on the parent story. Data-creating specs: the
  `cleanup` teardown runs per repeat — verify no leftovers on a shared SUT.
- Remaining FINALIZE links: the AI-QA stakeholder HTML (`uv run aiqa
  report-all` → `test-output/ai/`), the bug-drafts index (`uv run python -m
  aiqa_framework.shared.reporting.ensure_bug_drafts_index` — exists even when
  green), results-Excel re-export (verify the Status column is filled — a
  resultless sheet is a duplicate). Failures produce approval-gated bug
  DRAFTS only (root conftest gate; `JIRA_AUTO_BUG=yes` is the explicit opt-in).

### Phase 6 — ⏸ Review scripts + results → branch is AUTOMATIC on approval
Present for human review, with clickable links: every generated file (a
one-line plain-English summary each + `git diff --stat`), the run + stress
results per case (the 5/5 table), and the finalize artifact links. The MR
description follows the qa-agent best-practice format: what changed /
execution table / stress table / artifacts+Jira / reviewer notes. Wait for
explicit approval. **That approval IS the authorization to ship**: create
the branch, commit ONLY the generated files, push and open the MR
automatically — no second confirmation.
- Branch naming (team rule): **`test/manual-<feature-slug>-<YYYYMMDD>`**;
  when the cases carry a story key use **`test/<STORY-KEY>-<feature-slug>`**.
- MR via `../qa-agent/scripts/create_mr.py` — title
  `<feature>: qa-agent generated tests (manual cases)`, description = the
  review summary + artifact links. Show branch + MR link in the summary.
- Skippable on request; report "branch+MR skipped — repo not bootstrapped"
  if the remote is missing.

### Phase 7 — Update tracking (+ optional Jira)
- `docs/ai/<module>/test-case.md` — catalogue rows + statuses; `memory.md` —
  generated work, decisions, run history; `navigation.md` — new screens from
  Phase 2. Archive the frozen canonical JSON under `docs/ai/<module>/testcases/`.
- **Only if the cases carry a `userStoryKey`** and the user wants it: attach
  the Excel/report to the story (`attach_file_to_jira.py`) and create the
  qa-agent sub-tasks (`../qa-agent/references/jira-sync.md`).

## Hard rules
- Everything in the qa-agent Hard rules applies (approval gates, bug drafts
  never auto-filed, shared-SUT safety, anti-duplication, conventions,
  presentation rules — clickable file lists at every gate and summary).
- **Never fabricate steps.** A step the user didn't give and the live app
  didn't show does not go into a case; record it as an open question instead.
- **Exploration is read-first.** Creating data during exploration follows the
  framework's CRUD lifecycle discipline; destructive flows need explicit
  confirmation.

## Conflict order
1. explicit user instruction
2. `../qa-agent/references/framework-conventions.md`
3. this SKILL.md workflow
4. `../qa-agent/references/json-contract.md` / `test-case-template.md`
5. `../qa-agent/references/tracking-files.md` / `mcp-usage.md` / `test-management.md`
